i'm not sure this is a good move. because the lower half is bigger, black can secure a larger area be attacking this white stone. 
i have to ask someone better than me... ];B[oi]C[black closes the door. force white to live inside. 
another option is to play [r10\], b[q11\], that way white is heavier. ];W[qe]C[this is a tesuji (kind of dodging around try to escape) move, it's much better than playing R13 or P12 directly. ];B[qf];W[rf];B[qd];W[rd];B[pe];W[re];B[rg];W[rh];B[qg];W[rc];B[sf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qc];B[pc];W[qa];B[nb]C[white sacrifies the two stones out side and takes the corner (worth 5 points), maybe black could have player more aggresively, but this result is still fine for black. because black gets a strong wall and the O17 stone of white was hurt. 
but white's r11 stone still has some Aji (bad taste)...];W[ql]C[greedy white...];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[qm];B[rj];W[rl];B[qj];W[qo]C[it seems white easily settles down, but i don't know what's the better response. ];B[po];W[pn];B[qp];W[oo];B[pp];W[on];B[ro]C[black is trying not to give white eye shape. ];W[rn];B[qn];W[pm];B[sn];W[nq]C[white is free...];B[lq];W[lp]C[over play? ];B[mp];W[mq];B[lo];W[kp];B[mo];W[ko];B[kn];W[qo];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[lr];B[nm]C[looks like a ko...];W[rp];B[qn];W[ln];B[mn];W[qo];B[so];W[rq];B[qn];W[lm];B[mm];W[qo];B[mr];W[qn];B[nr];W[jn];B[km];W[ll];B[kl];W[lk]C[it not the white's stick is heavy, it's better to discard it. ];B[kq]C[it's time for white to play L9, the L4 group is junk, no need to rescue. ];W[io];B[jp];W[jo];B[kk];W[lj]C[now white has two lonely groups to take care of, black gained the initiative. ];B[ho];W[im];B[kj];W[li];B[hl];W[il];B[jh];W[lg];B[ik];W[hm];B[hk];W[gm]C[one group is free, but black is also stronger. and ...];B[kf]C[straight-line attacking. ];W[kg];B[jg];W[lf];B[ke];W[md];B[le];W[me];B[nf];W[jf];B[je];W[if];B[ie];W[hf];B[mf];W[he];B[id];W[lc];B[jc];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc];W[gb];B[fc];W[ib];B[ic];W[hb];B[ge];W[fd];B[gf];W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[ed]C[and now black can ladder the white two stones. two white small groups on the upper-side is close to death. eventually white rescue one of them but black killed another white group in the center and finished the game.
