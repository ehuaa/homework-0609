;W[eq]
;B[cn]C[
 ogre 5d*: this opening by W is favored by many korean pros
 ogre 5d*: Ma took a page from there
 ogre 5d*: old style was for W to play o3 next
 ogre 5d*: Ma chose a different way
]

;B[nq]
;W[rp]
;B[qq]
;W[qk]C[
 ogre 5d*: this is favored by Yoo 7p
]
;B[fc]
;W[hc]C[
 ogre 5d*: here, obviously B cannot follow the same joseki as in LL
 ogre 5d*: or else, his position would be too low
 ogre 5d*: Lee won the first game playing W
]
;B[cf]
;W[fd]
;B[cc]C[
 ogre 5d*: if W now blocks at c16, the outside strength is countered by B c6
]
;W[ec]
;B[cd]
;W[nc]
;B[qf]
;W[pb]
;B[qc]C[
 ogre 5d*: now W cannot fix both the invasion at the top and B aji at g17...
 ogre 5d*: so he chose another big point
]
;W[kq]
;B[mc]
;W[mb]
;B[nb]
;W[ob]
;B[nd]C[
 ogre 5d*: next move by W a bit surprising to me...
 ogre 5d*: usual move is W o19, B m17
 ogre 5d*: W's response is surprisingly effective
]
;W[oc]
;B[lb]
;W[na]C[
 ogre 5d*: B shape is now hard to fix
]
;B[od]
;W[lc]
;B[md]
;W[kc]C[
 ogre 5d*: pretty well-balanced game at this point
]

;B[ci]
;W[de]
;B[ce]C[
 ogre 5d*: frankly i am not sure W gained in this exchange
]
;W[lq]
;B[kr]
;W[jr]
;B[mq]
;W[ks]
;B[ms]C[
 ogre 5d*: at this point it seems W has to make a move at e7 or so
 ogre 5d*: but...
]

;B[dj]
;W[ei]
;B[cj]
;W[em]
;B[ej]
;W[dg]
;B[ch]
;W[hn]C[
 ogre 5d*: commentator says the key moves are now:
 ogre 5d*: first, how B exploits the aji at g17
 ogre 5d*: second, whether B gets j5, or W gets l5
 ogre 5d*: the moves e11, etc, helps g16 weakness
 ogre 5d*: here comes the excitement
]
;B[gc]C[
 ogre 5d*: well? any suggestions on W's response?
]
;W[gb]
;B[fb]
;W[eb]
;B[gd]
;W[fa]C[
 ogre 5d*: looks very dangerous for both...
]
;B[hb]
;W[ga]C[
 ogre 5d*: game was played about 12 hours ago
]
;B[jc]
;W[hd]
;B[kb]
;W[kd]
;B[id]
;W[ke]C[
 ogre 5d*: yes, W has to play strongly here
]
;B[ge]
;W[he]
;B[ie]
;W[hf]
;B[ic]
;W[if]C[
 ogre 5d*: ko now
]
;B[qb]C[
 ogre 5d*: if W now q18, B m19 and lives
 ogre 5d*: r18 is a must
]
;W[ha]C[
 ogre 5d*: someone said r18 was losing move?
]
;B[jb]
;W[pa]
;B[ia]
;W[ib]
;B[jf]
;W[kf]
;B[hb]
;W[ea]C[
 ogre 5d*: at this point, if B connects at k15, then cut outside, it would lead to yose-ko
 ogre 5d*: many-step ko
 ogre 5d*: so, lee chose an alternative way
]
;B[jg]
;W[je]
;B[gf]C[
 ogre 5d*: B's intention is clear now, he wants a trade
]
;W[ib]
;B[fg]
;W[hg]
;B[df]
;W[ja]C[
 ogre 5d*: h13 also a must, key point for both sides
 ogre 5d*: if W just takes ko, B would play h13
 ogre 5d*: if B just h13 instead of f13, W would play j13
 ogre 5d*: so, the moves here were quite natural
 ogre 5d*: the next move by B was considered questionable
 ogre 5d*: commentator said B should play strongly, perhaps at j5
 ogre 5d*: apparently Lee thought he was okay, and played rather slack
]
;B[rr]
;W[qp]
;B[pq]C[
 ogre 5d*: Seo 9p was the commentator
]
;W[ko]C[
 ogre 5d*: when W played l5, seems that game has tilted in his favor
]
;B[ka]
;W[ma]
;B[gi]
;W[bl]C[
 ogre 5d*: game is still very close, according to commentator
 ogre 5d*: B has an aji at r7, but in this case, W would just play r8
 ogre 5d*: B can get something on the outside....
 ogre 5d*: but W stone at l5 makes that uninteresting
]
;B[rk]
;W[rl]
;B[rj]
;W[sr]
;B[sq]
;W[po]C[
 ogre 5d*: these moves are all forced, no choice
 ogre 5d*: next move is another blunder by Lee
 ogre 5d*: t2 and t3 both right
 ogre 5d*: W can play t4 at any time
 ogre 5d*: but this way, he saves possible atari at r2
 ogre 5d*: q5 is a "must" defensive move
 ogre 5d*: other wise B has strong attack at q7
]
;B[db]C[
 ogre 5d*: d18 prevents W from playing at b18, but W liberties outside are very tight, he may not be able to play at b18
 ogre 5d*: so, B should play n13, W l13, then B o10
]
;W[kg]
;B[mg]C[
 ogre 5d*: now n13 a little late
]
;W[mi]C[
 ogre 5d*: W n11 a natural reduction
 ogre 5d*: not really, n11 quite common, no?
]
;B[oi]
;W[pj]
;B[oj]
;W[ok]
;B[nh]C[
 ogre 5d*: at this time, Ma must have been very happy...
 ogre 5d*: so, he played badly too :)
]
;W[nk]C[
 ogre 5d*: this move at o9 is almost dame
 ogre 5d*: W should play at g8 area
]
;B[gl]
;W[gm]
;B[jh]C[
 ogre 5d*: now, W is under pressure to capture all B stones
 ogre 5d*: but, still W is a little bit ahead
 ogre 5d*: so, Ma played another bad move :)
 ogre 5d*: commentator says W should play j11 now
]
;W[kh]C[
 ogre 5d*: but, commentator may not have fore-seen what Ma had in mind...
]
;B[ii]
;W[gh]C[
 ogre 5d*: this move is clever
]
;B[fh]
;W[hi]
;B[hj]
;W[hh]C[
 ogre 5d*: the commentator now has figured out what W had in mind...
 ogre 5d*: at this time, B must connect at g10, and gamble the game on getting the j11 stone out
]
;B[ij]
;W[fi]
;B[gj]C[
 ogre 5d*: now the coup de grace
]
;W[ef]
;B[eg]
;W[ff]
;B[fj]
;W[gg]C[
 ogre 5d*: now W is ahead on board...
 ogre 5d*: they played some more, but I won't show them now
 ogre 5d*: thanks for watching
