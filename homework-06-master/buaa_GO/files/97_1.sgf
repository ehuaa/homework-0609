C[Match Macfadyen-Matthews 
Game 1
Macfadyen had Black.  
White resigned at 118.

Comments by Seong-June Kim except where indicated (CRM is Charles Matthews, JF referee John Fairbairn, MM Matthew Macfadyen).];
B[od]
C[Matthew normally uses unorthodox openings, such as this 5-4 point (takamoku).  (CRM)];
W[dp]C[Now Black wants to continue with the 5-4 point.  Where?]
(;B[op]
C[Black had another choice of 5-4 formation, shown in the variation on move 2.];
W[ec]C[Now can Black play in the top left?]
(;B[pj]C[Not as good a formation as sanrensei ("three stars" two 4-4 points  and the 10-4 point on a side).  However Black really needed a move here.

Where next for White?]
(;W[cd]C[It would have been better to come into the lower right (variations for the last move).

Now Black will wedge to break up the left side.  There are three points on the third line which serve to give Black a two space extension either side.]
(;B[ci]C[What about the points one or two below? See variations for the previous move.];W[jq]
C[This is good.  Now can Black play on the lower side?  See the variation.]
(;B[jc]C[In the discussion after the game the players did not know what should come next at this point.]
(;W[qo];B[qq];W[ql]C[Now there is a move Black must play.]
(;B[lq];W[rj]
C[This result is good for White.  You can look at the shapes: Black's pieces in the top right are misplaced, while the rest of the board is normal as far as pattern goes.

(MM didn't see it that way, feeling that White has been weakened on the lower edge).

See the variation for Black's attempt to seal off the side.]
(;B[gp];W[cm]C[This is OK.  (JF had queried it after the game.  MM agreed it was better than the one point jump - it denies the wedge stone a full two point extension in one of the directions.)];B[dq]
(;W[eq];B[ep];W[cq];B[dr];W[fq]C[Black now goes wrong.]
(;B[cp]C[Unbelievable!  This and the next Black play are a bad idea.];
W[do];B[bq]C[Now White should take advantage.]
(;W[gq]C[This perhaps also possible.  The Black stones in the centre are very weak.  But should White play the atari at the 3-5 point first as a forcing move?

Given the way White plays a little later, he should have played it now.];B[co]
C[Black prevents the forcing move.  (This surprised me in the game.  I imagined that Black was therefore going to give up the stones on the outside. CRM)];
W[dn];B[fp];W[hp];B[gn]C[Now we come to a turning point in the fighting.]
(;W[ho]C[This move should not be played now.  (JF thought the game was over!)];B[fm];W[dj]
(;B[cj];W[dk];B[hn]C[This is good.  Perhaps it is the only way to play.

Now, how does White attack on the left side?];W[cg]C[White is still ahead when he plays this.]
(;W[cg];B[dg]C[White gets another chance to attack]
(;W[cf];B[di]C[Last chance for White to attack.]
(;W[fj];B[ei]C[Shape or run faster?]
(;W[fl]C[Wrong choice.];B[ck]C[Necessary?  Could also want this as the knight's move on the second line.];W[cl];B[em];W[dl];B[gh];W[hj]
C[The climax of the game has passed.  The situation is much improved for Black.  In fact he might now be ahead.

(Playing moves on the two sides meant my weak group stayed weak.  What is expected to be a favourable fight, one weak group between two, went sour as I missed my opportunities.  CRM)];

C[Really White has to pull out the single stone.];B[nq];W[lm]C[What happens if this is one to the left?]
;B[km];W[mn];B[kk]C[The result here is terrible for White, who now has two weak groups in the centre (and the one on the right side to worry about).

(White didn't get value for money from the sacrifice stone on the lower side. MM)];
W[ii];B[ih]
C[Leave this one out, just play the knight's move.];
W[jh];B[ig];W[lj];B[lk];W[nm];B[mj];W[li]C[This is heavy.  Play the diagonal move one to the left.]
;B[nk]C[The sealed move at lunch.];W[pl]C[Should be one point below, for better shape.];B[mh];W[lh];B[mg]C[Could be one to the
left.];W[lg];B[mf];W[ml];B[mk];W[jj]C[A key point for shape.  However, it doesn't threaten to wedge and cut.]
(;B[ri]
C[This is a long-awaited move, although the focus of the game was elsewhere.  White has to accept the challenge to keep in the game.  CRM.];
W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[rk];W[si];B[qk];W[qe]
C[Should play where Black goes next, first.  Also, must be one higher at the 3-4 point in the corner.  That would leave bad aji.  But if Black takes the 3-3 point in the corner White will also have bad aji.  White needs to play maximum moves now. (Last comment from Kim.)];B[rl];W[kl]C[White chooses the wrong way to make life (MM).];
B[jl];W[ll]
;B[kn];W[nl];B[on]C[On a key point (MM).];
W[om];B[pn];W[ok];B[oj];W[pm];B[nn]
C[White is short of liberties, and cannot cut on the outside (MM).];W[ln];B[pk];W[qn]
;B[rm];W[qm];B[jk]C[Now White cannot make a second eye on the edge, and resigned.

However the post-game discussion suggested that the group need not have died after having been cut off.  Cutting on the outside and fighting a semeai would have required eight or nine liberties (MM).

  Time used B 1:21 W 2:11.]

(;W[qc]C[Coming in at 3-3 is another possibility.]))
(;B[lq];W[jo] 
C[This exchange would leave Black with a poor formation in the bottom right.  Black can enclose at the 4-3 point there, but would probably then prefer to move the 5-4 point to the 4-4 to have a more secure corner. In that sense the 5-4 point is not as good as the 4-4 point for supporting an extension on the side.]))

C[This choice of wedge is quite dubious.  White's stones are working much more efficiently than Black's. (CRM)]))

(;B[cd];W[qj];B[qd];W[ic];B[qp];W[jq]
C[If Black allows White to wedge on the right side, the wedge piece will end up very well placed to neutralise the influence of Black's enclosures.]))

C[This formation is more coherent for Black.  (So perhaps White should play 4 in the top left. (CRM))]))
